Credit Card Checker Script
This script is used to check the validity of credit card numbers using an API. The script accepts an input file containing a list of credit card numbers, and outputs the results to an output file.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
The following Python libraries need to be installed:
requests
termcolor
Installation
Clone or download this repository.

Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
Copy code
'pip install requests termcolor''
Usage
To use the script, run the following command in the terminal:

Copy code
'python credit_card_checker.py input_file output_file''
where input_file is the name of the input file containing the credit card numbers, and output_file is the name of the output file where the results will be written.

The input file should contain one credit card number per line in the following format:

Copy code
ccNumber|expMonth|expYear|cvc
For example:

Copy code
'4111111111111111|12|2022|123''
The output file will contain the results for each credit card number, with the format:

rust
Copy code
'ccNumber|expMonth|expYear|cvc|Result'
where Result can be one of the following:

|Live| if the credit card number is valid.
|Dead| if the credit card number is invalid.
|Unknown| if the API response is not in the expected format.
The script will also print the output to the console with different colors depending on whether the credit card number is valid or not.
